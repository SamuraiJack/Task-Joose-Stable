IDEAS
=====

- VAR, GET, SET - analog of scoped variables



TASKS
=====

- RETURN from inside of CATCH scope

- create Task/ package to speedup the loading

- test the 'detachScope' method

- implement 'AND' method for parallel running tasks, and single exit point (?)
 - how to handle CATCH/THROW for them then?
 


DONE
====

- global CONT instead of scoped? (no attach then, only detach)
- clear CONT after returning from the continued method
- keep the intuitively expected scope during continued method calls (fixed?)



GARBAGE
=======

- do not remove CONT/RESULT after exiting the scope to slightly improve the performance?
